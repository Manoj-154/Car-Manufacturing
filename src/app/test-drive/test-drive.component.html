<p> Now that the car is ready to drive, it will be tested for quality assurance and safety.  <br>

The vehicle is checked for any imperfections or inconsistencies in the interior and exterior design.  <br>

The car will run through a series of tests similar to those given at a DMV: <br>
the engine is started and stopped several times, the steering alignment is adjusted, <br> the headlights are checked for brightness and reach, brakes are tested for safety, and more. <br>

Then, the car will be tested in heavy water pressure to find leaks. <br>

The cars programming will be tested, and the electrical units will be checked to ensure safety and accessibility. <br>

Finally, crash testing will be executed to observe how the car handles impacts, and to test airbag and seat belt performance. <br>

If the car requires no further tweaks in design and production for safety, then the car can be presented to the market. </p>
